Galry: high performance interactive visualization package in Python
===================================================================

Galry is a **high performance interactive visualization package in 
Python** based on OpenGL.
It allows to interactively visualize very large plots (tens of millions of
points) in real time, by using the graphics card as much as possible.

Galry's high-level interface is directly inspired from Matplotlib and Matlab.
The low-level interface can be used to write complex interactive visualization
GUIs with Qt that deal with large 2D/3D datasets.

Visualization capabilities of Galry are not restricted to plotting, and 
include textures, 3D meshes, graphs, shapes, etc. Custom shaders can also be
written for advanced uses.

Installation
------------

Galry should work on any platform (Window/Linux/MacOS).
Mandatory dependencies include Python 2.7, Numpy, either PyQt4 or PySide,
PyOpenGL, matplotlib. OpenGL v2+ is required (it's probably a good idea to
use the latest graphics card drivers).

Galry is licensed under the BSD license.
