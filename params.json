{"tagline":"High-performance interactive visualization in Python","body":"Galry is a **high performance interactive visualization package in \r\nPython** based on OpenGL.\r\nIt allows to interactively visualize very large plots (tens of millions of\r\npoints) in real time, by using the graphics card as much as possible.\r\n\r\nGalry's high-level interface is directly inspired by Matplotlib and Matlab.\r\nThe low-level interface can be used to write complex interactive visualization\r\nGUIs with Qt that deal with large 2D/3D datasets.\r\n\r\nVisualization capabilities of Galry are not restricted to plotting, and \r\ninclude textures, 3D meshes, graphs, shapes, etc. Custom shaders can also be\r\nwritten for advanced uses.\r\n\r\n[Click here to go to the FAQ](https://github.com/rossant/galry/blob/master/docs/faq.md).\r\n\r\n\r\nUser survey\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n[**We'd be very grateful if you could fill in this really short form if you're interested in Galry!**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dE5qZldRN3pvY2NEaXRhb2J4UDhoYWc6MQ#gid=0)\r\n\r\n\r\nGallery\r\n-------\r\n\r\n![Multiple plots](https://raw.github.com/rossant/galry/master/images/thumbnails/img0.jpg)\r\n![Multiple bar plots](https://raw.github.com/rossant/galry/master/images/thumbnails/img1.jpg)\r\n![Dynamic fractal](https://raw.github.com/rossant/galry/master/images/thumbnails/img5.jpg)\r\n\r\n[Click here to see all screenshots and videos](https://github.com/rossant/galry/blob/master/docs/gallery.md).\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nGalry should work on any platform (Window/Linux/MacOS).\r\nMandatory dependencies include Python 2.7, Numpy, either PyQt4 or PySide,\r\nPyOpenGL, matplotlib. OpenGL v2+ is required (it's probably a good idea to\r\nuse the latest graphics card drivers).\r\n\r\nGalry is licensed under the BSD license.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Click here to go to the installation page](https://github.com/rossant/galry/wiki/Installation).\r\n\r\n### Quick install\r\n\r\n  * Make sure you've installed all dependencies.\r\n  * Download galry's package (ZIP button on top of the page).\r\n  * Extract the package and do `python setup.py install`.\r\n  * To test it, open a Python or IPython prompt and type:\r\n    \r\n        from galry import *\r\n        from numpy.random import randn\r\n        plot(randn(3, 10000))\r\n        show()\r\n    \r\n  * You should see three overlayed random signals. You can navigate with the\r\n    mouse and the keyboard. Click on `H` to see all available actions.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuick links\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n  * [What's new?](https://github.com/rossant/galry/blob/master/CHANGES.md)\r\n  * [Installation page](https://github.com/rossant/galry/wiki/Installation)\r\n  * [User Manual](https://github.com/rossant/galry/blob/master/docs/manual.md)\r\n  * [Tutorials](https://github.com/rossant/galry/tree/master/tutorials)\r\n  * [Gallery](https://github.com/rossant/galry/blob/master/docs/gallery.md)\r\n  * [Benchmarks wiki](https://github.com/rossant/galry/wiki/Benchmarks)\r\n  * [FAQ](https://github.com/rossant/galry/blob/master/docs/faq.md)\r\n  * [Source code](https://github.com/rossant/galry)\r\n  * [Galry Users Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/galry-users)\r\n  * [Contact](http://cyrille.rossant.net)\r\n  \r\n  \r\n","google":"UA-6774000-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
