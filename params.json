{"name":"Galry","tagline":"High-performance interactive visualization in Python","body":"Galry is a **high performance interactive visualization package in \r\nPython** based on OpenGL.\r\nIt allows to interactively visualize very large plots (tens of millions of\r\npoints) in real time, by using the graphics card as much as possible.\r\n\r\nGalry's high-level interface is directly inspired by Matplotlib and Matlab.\r\nThe low-level interface can be used to write complex interactive visualization\r\nGUIs with Qt that deal with large 2D/3D datasets.\r\n\r\nVisualization capabilities of Galry are not restricted to plotting, and \r\ninclude textures, 3D meshes, graphs, shapes, etc. Custom shaders can also be\r\nwritten for advanced uses.\r\n\r\n[Click here to go to the FAQ](https://github.com/rossant/galry/blob/master/docs/faq.md).\r\n\r\n### Note\r\n\r\nThe library will be entirely rewritten in the coming months\r\nin the context of the [pyvis collaborative project](https://github.com/pyvis/pyvis).\r\nThe goal is to share common building blocks with other visualization libraries\r\n(visvis, pyqtgraph, glumpy...). The low-level API will change and we suggest not\r\nto use it in production for now.\r\n\r\n\r\nUser survey\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n[**We'd be very grateful if you could fill in this really short form if you're interested in Galry!**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dE5qZldRN3pvY2NEaXRhb2J4UDhoYWc6MQ#gid=0)\r\n\r\n\r\nGallery\r\n-------\r\n\r\n![Multiple plots](https://raw.github.com/rossant/galry/master/images/thumbnails/img0.jpg)\r\n![Multiple bar plots](https://raw.github.com/rossant/galry/master/images/thumbnails/img1.jpg)\r\n![Dynamic fractal](https://raw.github.com/rossant/galry/master/images/thumbnails/img5.jpg)\r\n\r\n[Click here to see all screenshots and videos](https://github.com/rossant/galry/blob/master/docs/gallery.md).\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n\r\n  * Galry should work on any platform (Window/Linux/MacOS).\r\n  * Mandatory dependencies include:\r\n  \r\n      * Python 2.7\r\n      * Numpy\r\n      * PyQt4 or PySide with the OpenGL bindings\r\n      * PyOpenGL\r\n      * matplotlib\r\n\r\n  * Your graphics card drivers must be up-to-date and support **OpenGL 2.1**.\r\n\r\nGalry is licensed under the BSD license.\r\n\r\n### Installation procedure\r\n\r\n  * [Download the package](http://galry.rossant.net/galry-0.1.0.rc1.zip).\r\n  * Extract it.\r\n  * Run in a console:\r\n  \r\n        python setup.py install\r\n        \r\n  * Test it:\r\n      \r\n        from galry import *\r\n        from numpy.random import randn\r\n        plot(randn(3, 10000))\r\n        show()\r\n        \r\n  * You should see three overlayed random signals. You can navigate with the\r\n    mouse and the keyboard.
