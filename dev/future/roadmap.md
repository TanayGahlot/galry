Roadmap
=======

  * Write many API examples (low-level, visual-level, high-level, etc.).
  * Design the APIs entirely.
  * Write unit tests.
  * Implement the APIs.

The low-level API should be the priority. Special attention should be given
to the code quality, and it should be thoroughly tested on multiple systems 
and graphics cards. In my experience, OpenGL drivers can be crappy and
weird bugs may appear only on some specific combinations of OS/graphics card
drivers.
